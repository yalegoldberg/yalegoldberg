      <p>Since 2020 our founder's mother has been growing bananas in her backyard in Naples, Florida. For the first year the bananas were extremely small, so almost everyone refused to eat them. Nobody had seen a banana the size of a thumb. As her children, our founder, Yale, and his brother, Mark, were obligated to try the bananas and when they did they fell in love. Yale and Mark ate so many bananas, but there were still hundreds of bananas that were going brown.</p>

      <p>With a massive excess of bananas, Yale started putting them in everything: yogurt bowls, cereal, pancakes, etc. Then he started putting the bananas in his ice cream bowls, sloshing the banana and vanilla ice cream around and making banana ice cream. Stomach aches were in abundance and our abs were gone! So, naturally, Yale decided to remove the dairy, added sugar and all of the BS ingredients that we had never heard of to make the healthiest and tastiest ice cream ever! Meet Nana’s Banana whip, we can’t wait for you to try it!</p>
